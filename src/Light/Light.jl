Light attenuation by chlorophyll as described by Karleskind et al. 2011 (implimented as 2λ)
- intend to change to model by Morel 2001 in the future

These should be used by setting up a callback like:
`simulation.callbacks[:update_par] = Callback(Light.update_2λ!, IterationInterval(1), merge(params, (surface_PAR=surface_PAR,)))`
