# *Ocean* *Bio*geochemical *M*odelling *E*nvironment - OceanBioME

OceanBioME.jl is a fast and flexible ocean biogeochemical modelling environment. It is highly modular and is designed to make it easy to implement and use a variety of biogeochemical and physical models. OceanBioME is built to be coupled with physics models from [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) allowing simulations across a wide range of spatial scales ranging from a global hydrostatic free surface model to non-hydrostatic large-eddy simulations. OceanBioME was designed specifically for ocean carbon dioxide removal applications. Notably, it includes active particles which allow individual-based models to be seamlessly coupled with the flow physics, ecosystem models, and carbonate chemistry.

OceanBioME.jl currently provides a core of several biogeochemical models Nutrient--Phytoplankton--Zooplankton--Detritus ([NPZD](@ref NPZD)), [LOBSTER](https://doi.org/10.1029/2004JC002588), a medium complexity model, and an early implementation of [PISCES](https://www.pisces-community.org/), a complex model. It also provides essential utilities like air-sea gas exchange models to provide appropriate top boundary conditions, a carbon chemistry model for computing the pCO₂, and sediment models to for the benthic boundary. 

OceanBioME.jl includes a framework for integrating the growth of [biological/active particles](@ref individuals) which move around and can interact with the (Eulerian) tracer fields - for example, consuming nutrients and carbon dioxide while releasing dissolved organic material. A growth model for sugar kelp is currently implemented using active particles, and this model can be used in a variety of dynamical scenarios including free-floating or bottom-attached particles.

## Quick install

OceanBioME is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,

1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

2. Launch Julia and type

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("OceanBioME")
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.10"

    OceanBioME.jl requires Julia version 1.10 or later.

## Running your first model

As a simple example lets run a Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD) model in a two-dimensional simulation of a buoyancy front. This example requires Oceananigans, so we install that first via:

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("Oceananigans")
```

and then:

```@example quickstart
using OceanBioME, Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.Units

grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size = (160, 32), extent = (10000meters, 500meters), topology = (Bounded, Flat, Bounded))

biogeochemistry = NutrientPhytoplanktonZooplanktonDetritus(; grid) 

model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, biogeochemistry,
                              advection = WENO(; grid),
			                  closure = AnisotropicMinimumDissipation(),
			                  buoyancy = SeawaterBuoyancy(constant_salinity = true))

@inline front(x, z, μ, δ) = μ + δ * tanh((x - 7000 + 4 * z) / 500)

Pᵢ(x, z) = ifelse(z > -50, 0.03, 0.01)
Nᵢ(x, z) = front(x, z, 2.5, -2)
Tᵢ(x, z) = front(x, z, 9, 0.05)

set!(model, N = Nᵢ, P = Pᵢ, Z = Pᵢ, T = Tᵢ)

simulation = Simulation(model; Δt = 50, stop_time = 4days)

simulation.output_writers[:tracers] = JLD2OutputWriter(model, model.tracers,
                                                       filename = "buoyancy_front.jld2",
                                                       schedule = TimeInterval(24minute),
                                                       overwrite_existing = true)

run!(simulation)
```

We can then load the saved output and visualize it:

```@example quickstart
T = FieldTimeSeries("buoyancy_front.jld2", "T")
N = FieldTimeSeries("buoyancy_front.jld2", "N")
P = FieldTimeSeries("buoyancy_front.jld2", "P")

xc, yc, zc = nodes(T)

times = T.times

using CairoMakie

n = Observable(1)

T_lims = (8.94, 9.06)
N_lims = (0, 4.5)
P_lims = (0.007, 0.02)

Tₙ = @lift interior(T[$n], :, 1, :)
Nₙ = @lift interior(N[$n], :, 1, :)
Pₙ = @lift interior(P[$n], :, 1, :)

fig = Figure(size = (1000, 520), fontsize = 20)

title = @lift "t = $(prettytime(times[$n]))"
Label(fig[0, :], title)

axis_kwargs = (xlabel = "x (m)", ylabel = "z (m)", width = 770, yticks = [-400, -200, 0])
ax1 = Axis(fig[1, 1]; title = "Temperature (°C)", axis_kwargs...)
ax2 = Axis(fig[2, 1]; title = "Nutrients concentration (mmol N / m³)",axis_kwargs...)
ax3 = Axis(fig[3, 1]; title = "Phytoplankton concentration (mmol N / m³)", axis_kwargs...)

hm1 = heatmap!(ax1, xc, zc, Tₙ, colorrange = T_lims, colormap = Reverse(:lajolla), interpolate = true)
hm2 = heatmap!(ax2, xc, zc, Nₙ, colorrange = N_lims, colormap = Reverse(:bamako), interpolate = true)
hm3 = heatmap!(ax3, xc, zc, Pₙ, colorrange = P_lims, colormap = Reverse(:bamako), interpolate = true)

Colorbar(fig[1, 2], hm1, ticks = [8.95, 9.0, 9.05])
Colorbar(fig[2, 2], hm2, ticks = [0, 2, 4])
Colorbar(fig[3, 2], hm3, ticks = [0.01, 0.02, 0.03])

rowgap!(fig.layout, 0)

record(fig, "buoyancy_front.mp4", 1:length(times)) do i
    n[] = i
end

nothing #hide
```

![buoyancy_front](buoyancy_front.mp4)

In the example above, `OceanBioME.jl` provides the `biogeochemistry` and everything else is taken care of by `Oceananigans.jl`. For comprehensive documentation of the physics modelling see [Oceananigans' Documentation](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/); for biogeochemistry and other features we provide read below.
