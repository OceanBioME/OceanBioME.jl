Combined with the pure-water properties available from the 1996 Release of the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS-95), and the densities from the 2003 Gibbs function of seawater, a new saline part of the Gibbs function is developed for seawater that has an extended range of validity including elevated temperatures and salinities. In conjunction with the IAPWS 2006 Release on ice, the correct description of concentrated brines by the new formulations permits an accurate evaluation of sea ice properties down to salinity saturation temperatures. The new Gibbs function is expressed in terms of the temperature scale ITS-90. Its input variable for the concentration is absolute salinity, available from the new Reference-Composition Salinity Scale of 2008.},

	abstract = {The SOLAS Air-Sea Gas Exchange (SAGE) Experiment was conducted in the western Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. During SAGE, gas transfer velocities were determined using the 3He/SF6 dual gas tracer technique, and results were obtained at higher wind speeds (16.0 m s−1) than in previous open ocean dual tracer experiments. The results clearly reveal a quadratic relationship between wind speed and gas transfer velocity rather than a recently proposed cubic relationship. A new parameterization between wind speed and gas transfer velocity is proposed, which is consistent with previous 3He/SF6 dual tracer results from the coastal and open ocean obtained at lower wind speeds. This suggests that factors controlling air-sea gas exchange in this region are similar to those in other parts of the world ocean, and that the parameterization presented here should be applicable to the global ocean.},

@article{Aumont2015,
   abstract = {PISCES-v2 (Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies volume 2) is a biogeochemical model which simulates the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems (phytoplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and of the main nutrients (P, N, Fe, and Si). The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are 24 prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod-quota formalism. On the one hand, stoichiometry of C / N / P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicon quotas are variable and the growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting, for instance, the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady-state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data. Finally, some of the new functionalities of PISCES-v2 are tested in a series of sensitivity experiments.},
