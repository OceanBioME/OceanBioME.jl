	abstract = {The specific Gibbs energy of seawater is determined from experimental data of heat capacities, freezing points, vapour pressures and mixing heats at atmospheric pressure in the range −6 to 80$\,^{\circ}$C in temperature and 0--120gkg--1 in absolute salinity. Combined with the pure-water properties available from the 1996 Release of the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS-95), and the densities from the 2003 Gibbs function of seawater, a new saline part of the Gibbs function is developed for seawater that has an extended range of validity including elevated temperatures and salinities. In conjunction with the IAPWS 2006 Release on ice, the correct description of concentrated brines by the new formulations permits an accurate evaluation of sea ice properties down to salinity saturation temperatures. The new Gibbs function is expressed in terms of the temperature scale ITS-90. Its input variable for the concentration is absolute salinity, available from the new Reference-Composition Salinity Scale of 2008.},

	abstract = {The SOLAS Air-Sea Gas Exchange (SAGE) Experiment was conducted in the western Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. During SAGE, gas transfer velocities were determined using the 3He/SF6 dual gas tracer technique, and results were obtained at higher wind speeds (16.0 m s−1) than in previous open ocean dual tracer experiments. The results clearly reveal a quadratic relationship between wind speed and gas transfer velocity rather than a recently proposed cubic relationship. A new parameterization between wind speed and gas transfer velocity is proposed, which is consistent with previous 3He/SF6 dual tracer results from the coastal and open ocean obtained at lower wind speeds. This suggests that factors controlling air-sea gas exchange in this region are similar to those in other parts of the world ocean, and that the parameterization presented here should be applicable to the global ocean.},
